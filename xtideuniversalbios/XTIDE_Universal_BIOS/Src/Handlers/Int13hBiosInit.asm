;--------------------------------------------------------------------
; Int 13h software interrupt handler.
; This handler captures boot sector read from foreign drive when our
; INT 19h is not called. This way we can force XTIDE Universal BIOS
; initialization even without INT 19h being called.
;
; Int13hBiosInit_Handler
;	Parameters:
;		AH:		Bios function
;				READ_SECTORS_INTO_MEMORY will initialize XTIDE Universal BIOS
;--------------------------------------------------------------------
Int13hBiosInit_Handler:
	; Initialize XTIDE Universal BIOS only if Int13hBiosInit_Handler is still at
	; vector 13h. Otherwise some other BIOS has hooked us and our very late
	; initialization is not possible.
