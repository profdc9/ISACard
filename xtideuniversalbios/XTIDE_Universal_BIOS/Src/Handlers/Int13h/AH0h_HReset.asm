; Int 13h function AH=0h, Disk Controller Reset.
;
; Note: We handle all AH=0h calls, even for drives handled by other
; BIOSes!
;
; AH0h_HandlerForDiskControllerReset
;	Parameters:
;		DL:		Translated Drive number (ignored so all drives are reset)
;				If bit 7 is set all hard disks and floppy disks reset.
;		DS:DI:	Ptr to DPT (or Null if foreign drive)
;		SS:BP:	Ptr to IDEPACK
;	Returns with INTPACK:
;		AH:		Int 13h return status (from drive requested in DL)
;		CF:		0 if successful, 1 if error
;--------------------------------------------------------------------
AH0h_HandlerForDiskControllerReset:
	; Reset foreign Floppy and Hard Drives (those handled by other BIOSes)

	call	BackupErrorCodeFromTheRequestedDriveToBH

%ifdef MODULE_SERIAL_FLOPPY
;
; "Reset" emulated serial floppy drives, if any.  There is nothing to actually do for this reset,
; but record the proper error return code if one of these floppy drives is the drive requested.
;
	call	RamVars_UnpackFlopCntAndFirstToAL
	cbw													; Clears AH (there are flop drives) or ffh (there are not)
														; Either AH has success code (flop drives are present)
														; or it doesn't matter because we won't match drive ffh

	adc		dl, al										; second drive (CF set) if present
														; If no drive is present, this will result in ffh which

	; Resetting our hard disks will modify dl and bl to be idevars offset based instead of drive number based,
	; such that this call must be the last in the list of reset routines called.
	;
	; This needs to happen after ResetForeignDrives, as that call may have set the error code for 80h,
	; and we need to override that value if we are xlate'd into 80h with one of our drives.

;				enter through .ErrorCodeNotUsed.
