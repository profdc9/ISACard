	; 8-bit DMA transfers must be done within 64k physical page.
	; XT-CF support maximum of 64 sector (32768 bytes) blocks in DMA mode
	; so we never need to separate transfer to more than 2 separate DMA operations.

	mov		ax, di
	neg		ax			; 2s complement

	; If DI was zero carry flag will be cleared (and set otherwise)

	; XT-CFv3 block size to 32k

;	Parameters:

;		DX:		XT-CFv3 Control Register
;		ES:		Bits 3..0 have physical address bits 19..16

	; XT-CF transfers 16 bytes at a time. We need to manually start transfer for every block by writing (anything)
	; to the XT-CFv3 Control Register, which raises DRQ thereby passing system control to the 8237 DMA controller.
	; The XT-CFv3 logic releases DRQ after 16 transfers, thereby handing control back to the CPU and allowing any other IRQs or
	; DRQs to be serviced (which, on the PC and PC/XT will include DRAM refresh via DMA channel 0).  The 16-byte transfers can
	; also be interrupted by the DMA controller raising TC (i.e. when done).  Each transfer cannot be otherwise interrupted
	; and is therefore atomic (and hence fast).
